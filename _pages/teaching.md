**ECEN 489/689: Application of Data Science in Modern Power Systems**

**Instructor**: Tong Huang and Dr. Le Xie; **TA**: Rayan El Helou; **Semester:** 2020 Spring

* **Course Description:** The electric power grid is transforming itself from a hierarchical, passive, and sparsely-sensed engineering system into a flat, active, and ubiquitously-sensed cyber-physical system. The emerging multi-scale data from synchrophasors, smart meters, weather, and electricity markets offers tremendous opportunities as well as scientific challenges to dynamically learn and adaptively control a smart grid. This course introduces the foundation of high dimensional spaces and data analytical tools necessary to model and operate a modern power system. Course projects will offer realistic data sets to allow students to construct tools and models for smart grid operations. 

* **Topics Covered:** High-dimensional data analytics, clustering and classification, time series, deep learning, and their applications in massively digitized power systems.
