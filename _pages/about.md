I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems ([LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu)) at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu). Before joining MIT, I was a postdoc researcher in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University where I obtained my Ph.D. degree in 2021. My research focuses on data analytics, physical/cyber resilience enhancement, and security analysis in massively digitized power grid. From September to December of 2018, I was a visiting Ph.D. student in the LIDS at MIT. My industry experience includes an internship at [ISO-New England](https://www.iso-ne.com) in 2018 and an internship at [Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories](https://www.merl.com) in 2019.

<span style="color:#347235">I will join the ECE department at San Diego State University as a tenure-track Assistant Professor, starting Aug. 2022. My research focuses on data analytics, cyber security, and modeling and control of electric energy systems with inverter-based resources. I am recruiting for <span style="color:#AA6C39">**two fully funded Ph.D. positions**</span>. If you are interested in joining my research group, please email your CV and transcript to tonghuang21 AT gmail DOT com</span>
