I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/index.html) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu) since September 2017. My advisor is [Prof. Le Xie](http://www.ece.tamu.edu/~le.xie/). From September to December of 2018, I was a visiting student in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems ([LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu)) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ([MIT](http://www.mit.edu)). I worked as an intern researcher at ISO New England from January to May of 2018. My research focuses on data analytics in electric power systems.
